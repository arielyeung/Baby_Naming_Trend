# Baby Naming Trend

## Introduction
Ever wonder how many people in the US share the same name as you? The naming trend data from Social Security application might be a way to find out the answer. The data records the number of babies born with a particular name for each year and each state starting from 1910 and is available on Data.gov. Only popular names (names with at least 5 babies born in the same year and same state) are included in the dataset.

The project is inspired by this dataset and I would like to look at the trends in how babies born in the US are named through visualization.

Although the data from as early as 1910 is available, I've decided to focus on data starting from 1936 for more accurate trend since the Social Security Administration was established in August 14, 1935 and probably not that many people applied for Social Security before that.
