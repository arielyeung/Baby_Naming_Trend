# Baby Naming Trend

## Introduction
Ever wonder how many people in the US share the same name as you? The naming trend data from Social Security application might be a way to find out the answer. The data records the number of babies born with a particular name for each year and each state starting from 1910 and is available on Data.gov. Only popular names (names with at least 5 babies born in the same year and same state) are included in the dataset.

The project is inspired by this dataset. I would like to look at what might affect how parents in the US name their babies and some recent naming trends through visualization.


One of the factors that I explored is celebrity influence. The naming trend of the name Kobe suggests that the NBA star Kobe Bryant does influence people's decision in choosing a baby name.
