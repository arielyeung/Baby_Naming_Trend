# Baby Naming Trend

## Introduction
Ever wonder how many people in the US share the same name as you? The naming trend data from Social Security application might be a way to find out the answer. The data records the number of babies born with a particular name for each year and each state starting from 1910 and is available on Data.gov. Only popular names (names with at least 5 babies born in the same year and same state) are included in the dataset.

The project is inspired by this dataset. I would like to look at what might affect how parents in the US name their babies and some recent naming trends through visualization.


One of the factors that I explored is celebrity influence. The naming trend of the name Kobe suggests that the NBA star Kobe Bryant does influence people's decision in choosing a baby name.

I also looked at what are the most frequently used name in the past decades. From the wordcloud, Sophia and Emma are the most popular girls' name.

For boys, we have Mason and Noah.

For the rest of the project I also explored the naming trend and geographic difference of some celebrities' name, as well as some recent popular names.
