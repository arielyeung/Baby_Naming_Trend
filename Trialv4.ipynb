We also find out the names that top the list of most frequently used names in the past decade and they are Sophia, Emma, Mason and Noah."

    "When comparing the number of births and the number of babies applying for Social Security, the big gap between the two from 1910s to 1930s is probably because the Social Security Administration was established in August 14, 1935 and not that many people applied for Social Security before that. Thus, data from Social Security application before 1936 would underestimate the actual number of babies born with a particular name and therefore, I've decided to only focus on the data starting from 1936."
